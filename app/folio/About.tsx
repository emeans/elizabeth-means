          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I work at the intersection of product strategy, design, and engineering—bridging what 
            users need with what's technically possible. My path here has been unconventional: I 
            started with an art foundation before transitioning to computer science, then spent a 
            decade as a full-stack engineer and engineering leader. Along the way, I discovered 
            what energizes me most: understanding people's needs and synthesizing that into 
            solutions that work for users, businesses, and the teams building them.

          <p>
            Most recently, I led product development for a management information system serving 
            the WIC program. I conducted 40+ discovery sessions with stakeholders across multiple 
            states, translated insights into product strategy and design solutions in Figma, and 
            led a cross-functional engineering team of 8. I presented our product at five national 
            conferences, gathering user feedback to inform our roadmap and prioritization decisions.

          <p>
          I bring a unique perspective: deep technical credibility from shipping production 
          systems, design thinking from creating 100+ Figma mockups and championing design 
          systems, product sense from synthesizing user research into business strategy, 
          and cross-functional leadership from mentoring engineering teams and fostering 
          collaborative, human-centered culture. I&apos;m currently completing a UX Research 
          & Design certification from the University of Michigan and am drawn to roles where 
          I can bridge disciplines—whether that's as a design engineer, technical product 
          manager, or anywhere user needs meet technical implementation.
