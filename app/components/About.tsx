          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My path to design has been unconventional. I started with an art foundation before
            transitioning to computer science, then spent a decade as a full-stack engineer and
            engineering leader. Along the way, I discovered what energizes me most: understanding
            what people need and creating solutions that work for both users and the teams building
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past two years, I've been leading product development for a management
            information system serving the WIC program. I conduct discovery sessions with
            stakeholders, create design solutions in Figma, and lead a cross-functional engineering
            team. I've also championed design systems thinking—co-founding my company's internal
            Design Group and publishing articles about user-centered design.

            I'm currently completing a UX Research & Design certification from the University of
            Michigan to formalize skills I've been developing through practice. I'm drawn to design
            systems, stakeholder discovery, and the challenge of creating experiences that are both
            beautiful and buildable.
